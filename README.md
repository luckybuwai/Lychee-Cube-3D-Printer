## Introduction
`Lychee Cube` is an open source project designed out of personal interest. \
The project is named ‘Lychee’, a fruit of southern China. 

This project provides a DIY Kit for a compact 3D printer that maximizes printing space utilization. The frame size of this machine is L310 mm * W310 mm * H340mm. The building size is X200 mm * Y200 mm * Z150mm. 

Main features of this machine include the Core-XY belt motion system, triple-Z auto bed leveling, linear rail guided XYZ movement, 220V heating bed, robust frame, low centre of gravity construction and so on.
